# Anna's Case Study

## Problem focused questions

### Q1. What problems are facing the organization?
The US education system is wasting billions of dollars on educational software that fails to meet the needs of individual schools.

### Q2. What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?
The nonprofit is developing a classification model to find the best mathematics software for individual schools, where the target variable is the effectiveness of the software as seen from decreased costs associated with ineffective software, increased student performance, and teacher satisfaction.

### Q3. How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?
They would know the solution is working from the financial savings and consistency in use of the software by schools -- additionally, this could include teacher satisfaction and student performance.

### Q4. What other issues might the team be facing?
The team could face technical and ethically questions, such as the individual budgets, priorities, and cultural factors each district may have.

## Data to Concept Questions

### Q5. How difficult is the data to gather?
Due to the small size of teh dataset, gathering data can be quite difficult. Additionally,the response bias and inconsistencies in how data may be interpreted from the questions could lead to noise and complications in the modeling process.

### Q6. Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
The target could be difficult to measure due to the numerous factors that go in to deciding its effectiveness, in addition to the process of gathering post-implementation data. The target would be easier to break into smaller parts due to the variety of different ways it could be measured.

### Q7. What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
Since the consequence of developing a bad model could lead to more ineffective software and as a result increased costs, there is some risk involved with a bad model. While the districts involved can do their own research into the software predicted by the model, uncertainty from the model could lead to direct impacts on student performance, teacher satisfaction, and drained costs.
